// ðŸ§© Problem 2: Treasure Map Paths
// You have a map of one-way paths between landmarks on an island: paths[i] = [fromLandmark, toLandmark]. 
// You always start at "CAMP", and you must find a path that uses as many paths as possible without revisiting any path.
// If there are multiple paths of the same length, return the one that is lexicographically smallest.
